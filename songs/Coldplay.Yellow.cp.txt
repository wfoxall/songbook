[B]Look at the stars
Look how they shine for [F#]you
And everything you [E]do
Yeah, they were all yellow[B] 

[B]I came along
I wrote a song for [F#]you
And all the things you [E]do
And it was called, "Yellow"
[B]So then I took my [F#]turn
Oh, what a thing to have [E]done
And it was all [B]yellow  [Bsus4]          [B].

[E9]You know I love you so
