[G]Run, run like the [C/A]wind
Don't wait for a [G/B]thing
There is [C]nothing here for [G]you
[G]But if you [C/A]stay
Then let me [G/B]say
I'll go [C]out of my way...for [G]you
[G]It's not like [C/A]before
I'll say no [G/B]more
Every[C]one else has said it for [G]me
Beautiful [C/A]tree
Beautiful [G/B]tree
it's a [C]shame that the root of its [G]me

{start_of_verse}
Sleep, sleep on the floor
Knock on the door
To tell me if you want some more
I can't relate
To what's on your plate
My appetite never failed before
Beautiful tree
Beautiful tree
it's a shame that the root of its me
Beautiful tree
Beautiful tree
it's a[D] s[Cadd9]hame th[Cadd9]at the root of its me

Tell me tomorrow, I'll wait by the window for you

{start_of_verse}
Run, run like the wind
Don't wait for a thing
There is nothing here for you
But if you stay
Then let me say
I'll go out of my way...for you
It's not like before
I say no more
Everyone else has said it for me
Beautiful tree
Beautiful tree
it's a[D] s[Cadd9]hame th[Cadd9]at the root of its me
