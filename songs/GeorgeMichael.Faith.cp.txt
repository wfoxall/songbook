{start_of_verse}
Well, I guess it would be [B]nice if I could touch your body
I know not [E]everybody has got a body like [B]you
But I gotta think [B]twice before I give my heart away
And I know [E]all the games you play because I played them, [B]too

Oh, but I [E]need some time off from [B]that emotion
[E]Time to pick my heart up off the [B]floor
Oh, [E]when that love comes down with[B]out de[G#m]votion
Well, it [C#m7]takes a strong man, baby
But I'm [F#]showin' you the door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
'Cause I gotta have [B]faith
I gotta' have [B]faith
Because I gotta have [B]faith, faith, faith
I got to have [B]faith, faith, faith
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[B]Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please, please, [E]please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the [B]blues
[B]Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but [E]think of yesterday
And another who [B]tied me down to loverboy rules

Be[E]fore this river be[B]comes an ocean
Be[E]fore you throw my heart back on the [B]floor
Oh, baby, I [E]reconsider my [B]foolish [G#m]notion
Well, I [C#m7]need someone to hold me
but I'll [F#]wait for somethin' more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[N.C]Yes, I gotta have [B]faith
Ooh, I gotta have [B]faith
Because I gotta have [B]faith, faith, faith
I gotta have [B]faith, faith, faith

[B]         
[E]        I'll just have to [B]wait
Because I've got to have [B]faith
I gotta have [E]faith
I've got to, got to, got to have [B]faith


[E]Before this river be[B]comes an ocean
Be[E]fore you throw my heart back on the [B]floor (I just gotta have faith)

Oh, oh, baby, I [E]reconsider my [B]foolish [G#m]notion
Well, I [C#m7]need someone to hold me but I'll [F#]wait for somethin' more....
