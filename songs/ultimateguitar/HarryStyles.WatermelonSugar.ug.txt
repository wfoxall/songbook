[Verse 1]
               Dm7
   Tastes like strawberries
        Am7
   On a summer evening
C                            G
   And it sounds just like a song
          Dm7
   I want more berries
            Am7
   And that summer feeling
C                        G
   It's so wonderful and warm
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           Dm7            Am7
Breathe me in, breathe me out
        C                           G
I don't know if I could ever go without
         Dm7          Am7
I'm just thinking out loud
        C                           G
I don't know if I could ever go without
 
 
[Chorus]
                 Dm7
Watermelon sugar high
                 Am7
Watermelon sugar high
