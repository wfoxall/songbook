Capo: 2

[Intro]
E                              E7
When there's nowhere else to run
                           A
Is there room for one more son?
         E
One more son?
       C#m
If you can hold on,
       A                E
If you can hold on, hold on.
 
[Verse]
E
I want to stand up, I want to let go
                                        A
You know you know - no, you don't, you don't.
                                    E
I want to shine on in the hearts of men.
 
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand.
 
E
Another head aches, another heart breaks.
                              A
I'm so much older than I can take.
                                     E
And my affection, well it comes and goes.
 
I need direction to perfection, no no no no
 
[Hook]
E
Help me out, yeah
 
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
                           A
Oh don't you put me on the back burner,
                           E
You know you gotta help me out, yeah.
 
[Verse]
E
And when there's nowhere else to run
                              A
Is there room for one more son?
 
These changes ain't changing me,
     E
The cold-hearted boy I used to be.
 
[Chorus]
E
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
                           A
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
                            E
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
                            C#m
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
 
[Bridge]
                            A
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
                            E
You're gonna bring yourself down.
 
E
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
 
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
A
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
E
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier (2x)
C#m
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
A                               E
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier
 
[Chorus]
E
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
                           A
Oh don't you put me on the back burner
                            E
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
                            E
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
 
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
                           A
Oh don't you put me on the back burner,
                            E
You're gonna bring yourself down
 
[Outro]
C#m      F#m               A
Over and in, last call for sin.
                                     B
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
                                E
With all these things that I've done.
                                C#m
With all these things that I've done.
       A                   B           E
If you can hold on, if you can hold on...
