[Verse 1]
E                     C#m7               Amaj7
When I wake up in the morning love
Amaj7                         Cmaj7 Bm7
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
E                     C#m7             Amaj7
And something without warning love
Amaj7             Cmaj7
Bears heavy on my mind
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am7/D                Bm7/E
Then I look at you
                 Am7               Bm7
And the world's alright with me
Am7/D                  Bm7/E
Just one look at you
                Am7       Bm7
And I know it's gonna be
 
[Chorus]
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)
 
[Verse 2]
E                      C#m7               Amaj7
When the day that lies ahead of me
Amaj7                     Cmaj7  Bm7
Seems impossible to face
E                   C#m7              Amaj7
When someone else instead of me
Amaj7                    Cmaj7
Always seems to know the way
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am7/D                Bm7/E
Then I look at you
                 Am7              Bm7
And the world's alright with me
Am7/D                  Bm7/E
Just one look at you
                Am7       Bm7
And I know it's gonna be
 
[Chorus]
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
