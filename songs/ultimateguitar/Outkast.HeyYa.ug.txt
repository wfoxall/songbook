[Intro]
N.C.             G
One, two, three, uh!
 
[Verse 1]
              C
My baby don't mess around
            C
Because she loves me so
           D        E
And this I know for sure
G              C
  But does she really wanna
          C
But can't stand to see me
     D       E
Walk out the door
G              C
  Don't try to fight the feeling
           C
'Cause the thought alone
           D        E
Is killing me right now
G               C
  Thank God for mom and dad
             C
For sticking two together
          D          E
'Cause we don't know how
 
[Chorus]
G      C
Heeeey yaaaaa...
D   E
Hey yaaaaa...
G      C
Heeeey yaaaaa...

[Verse 2]
G                          C
  You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
    C
But got it just don't get it
             D           E
Till there's nothing at all
G                  C
  We get together, oh we get together
    C
But separate's always better
             D          E
When there's feelings involved
G                      C
  If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
     C
Then what makes, then what makes,
     D                E
Then what makes, then what makes, love exception
G
  So why you, why you, 
C                                   C
why you, why you, why you... are so in denial
        D              N.C.
When we know we're not happy here...
