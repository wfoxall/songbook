[Intro]
F#m D A E/G# x4
 
 
[Verse 1]
F#m                D                  A              E/G#
   You were a child, crawling on your knees toward it
F#m               D     A                       E/G#
   Making mama so proud, but your voice was too loud
F#m D                 A           E/G#
     We like to watch you laughing
F#m                         D      A                         E/G#
   You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m                 D                   A           E/G#
   Control yourself, take only what you need from it
F#m            D            A             E/G#
   A family of trees wanting to be haunted
F#m                 D                   A           E/G#
   Control yourself, take only what you need from it
F#m            D            A             E/G#
   A family of trees wanting to be  haunted
 
 
[Verse 2]
F#m                  D                 A         E/G#
   The water is warm, but it's sending me shivers
F#m              D A                E/G#
   A baby is born   crying out for attention
F#m                   D                       A            E/G#
   Your memories fade, like looking through a fogged mirror
F#m                           D                         A
   Decisions to decisions are made and not bought but I thought
                     E/G#
This wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m                 D                   A           E/G#
   Control yourself, take only what you need from it
F#m            D            A             E/G#
   A family of trees wanting to be haunted
F#m                 D                   A           E/G#
   Control yourself, take only what you need from it
F#m            D            A             E/G#
   A family of trees wanting to be  haunted

   Control yourself, take only what you need from it
F#m            D            A             E/G#
   A family of trees wanting to be haunted
F#m                 D                   A           E/G#
