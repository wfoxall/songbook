         (Yo', man) Yo'
             Cmaj7                   Dm7/Bb
(Open up, man) What do you want, man?
              Cmaj7      Bbmaj7
(My girl just caught me) You let her catch you?
Cmaj7                        Dm7/Bb       Cmaj7
(I don't know how I let this happen) With who?
               Bbmaj7        Cmaj7
(The girl next door, you know) Man
Dm7/Bb                   Cmaj7              Bbmaj7
(I don't know what to do) Say it wasn't you   (Alright)
 
[Verse]
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Cmaj7                       Bbmaj7
Creeping with the girl next door
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7
Banging on the bathroom floor
          Cmaj7  Dm7/Bb
How could I for--get that I had
Cmaj7              Bbmaj7
Given her an extra key
         Cmaj7        Dm7/Bb
All this time she was standing there
    Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7
She never took her eyes off me
 
[Bridge]
        Cmaj7                              Dm7/Bb
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
                 Cmaj7                           Bbmaj7
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
                      Cmaj7                       Dm7/Bb
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
                     Cmaj7                     Bbmaj7
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
             Cmaj7                          Dm7/Bb
To be a true player you have to know how to play
             Cmaj7                     Bbmaj7
If she say a night, convince her say a day
        Cmaj7                  Dm7/Bb
Never admit to a word when she say
                      Cmaj7                Bbmaj7
And if she claims and you tell her baby no way
 
[Chorus]
Cmaj7                    Dm7/Bb
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                 Bbmaj7
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                 Bbmaj7
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                   Dm7/Bb
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                  Bbmaj7
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                Dm7/Bb
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7
She stayed until it was over
 
[Verse]
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Cmaj7                       Bbmaj7
Creeping with the girl next door
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7
Banging on the bathroom floor
      Cmaj7    Dm7/Bb
I had tried to keep her
          Cmaj7            Bbmaj7
From what she was about to see
           Cmaj7 Dm7/Bb
Why should she believe me
       Cmaj7              Bbmaj7
When I told her it wasn't me
 
[Bridge]
                         Cmaj7                             Dm7/Bb
Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on the right prefix
                    Cmaj7                    Bbmaj7
Whenever you should see her make the giggolo flex
               Cmaj7                     Dm7/Bb
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
            Cmaj7                             Bbmaj7
Seeing is believing so you better change your specs
                       Cmaj7                             Dm7/Bb
You know she not gonna be worrying 'bout things from the past
            Cmaj7                                  Bbmaj7
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
              Cmaj7           Dm7/Bb
Wait for your answer: go over there
                  Cmaj7                       Bbmaj7
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast
 
[Chorus]
Cmaj7                    Dm7/Bb
But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                 Bbmaj7
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb

Cmaj7                 Bbmaj7

Cmaj7                   Dm7/Bb
She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                  Bbmaj7
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Cmaj7                Dm7/Bb

Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7

Cmaj7                       Bbmaj7
Creeping with the girl next door
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb

Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7

          Cmaj7  Dm7/Bb

    Cmaj7                   Bbmaj7
She never took her eyes off me
 
[Bridge]
      Cmaj7             Dm7/Bb
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry
        Cmaj7          Bbmaj7
For the pain that I've caused
          Cmaj7             Dm7/Bb
I've been listening to your reason
         Cmaj7          Bbmaj7
It makes no sense at all
          Cmaj7             Dm7/Bb
We should tell her that I'm sorry
        Cmaj7          Bbmaj7
For the pain that I've caused
        Cmaj7               Dm7/Bb
You may think that you're a player
           Cmaj7      Bbmaj7
But you're completely lost. That's why I sing
 
[Verse]
Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Cmaj7                       Bbmaj7

Cmaj7                 Dm7/Bb
