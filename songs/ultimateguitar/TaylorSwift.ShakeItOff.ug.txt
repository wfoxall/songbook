[Intro]
G
 
[Verse 1]
               Am
I stay out too late
                  C
Got nothing in my brain
                   G
That's what people say, mmm
 
That's what people say, mmm
                 Am
I go on too many dates
                     C
But I can't make 'em stay
                            G
At least that's what people say, mmm   
 
That's what people say, mmm
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
           Am
But I keep cruisin' 
                      C
Can't stop won't stop moving 
                     G
It's like I got this music in my mind
       G
Saying it's gonna be alright
 
[Chorus]
          Am
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
        C
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
G
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
      Am
Heart breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
        C
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
G
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 
Shake it off, I shake it off
 
[Verse 2]
               Am*
I never miss a beat
                     C*
I'm lightening on my feet
                           G
And that's what they dont' see, mmm
That's what they dont' see, mmm
                  Am
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
                            C
I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
                           G
And that's what they don't know, mmm
 
That's what they don't know, mmm
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
           Am
But I keep cruisin' 
                      C
Can't stop won't stop groovin'
                     G
It's like I got this music in my mind
       G*/mute
Saying it's gonna be alright
 
[Chorus]
          Am
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
        C
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
G
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
      Am
Heart breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
        C
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby

[Interlude]
*tap guitar to the beat*
N.C.
Hey, hey, hey, just think
 
While you've been gettin' down and out
 
About the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world
 
You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat
 
 
[Bridge]
Am                    C
