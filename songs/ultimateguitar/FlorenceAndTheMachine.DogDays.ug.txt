[Intro]
 
[Verse]
 
G                                       Am Em
  Happiness hit her like a train on a track...
G                                             Am Em
  Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back...
G
  She hid around corners and she hid under beds
G                       Am       Em
  She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
     G
With every bubble she sank with her drink
      G         Am          Em
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    G
The dog days are over
    G
The dog days are done
    G          Am
The horses are coming
   Em
So you better run
 
 
[Verse]
 
    G
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
G
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
G                             Am
Leave all your loving, your loving behind
          Em
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    G
The dog days are over
    G
The dog days are done
G                   Am
Can you hear the horses?
       Em              G
'Cause here they come
 
(silence)
 
 
[Verse]
 
(quiet)
 
    G G            G        Am      Em
And I never wanted anything from you
       G        G                 G             Am         Em
Except for everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
 
(loud again)
 
G                G                     G  Am Em
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head.....
G                          G               G              Am        Em
 Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    G
The dog days are over
    G
The dog days are done
G                   Am
Can you hear the horses?
       Em             G
'Cause here they come
 
(Percussion interlude)
 
 
[Verse]
 
    G
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
G
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
G                           Am
Leave all your loving, your loving behind
          Em
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    G
The dog days are over
    G
The dog days are done
G                   Am
Can you hear the horses?
       Em
'Cause here they come
 
    G
The dog days are over
    G
The dog days are done
G                Am
The horses are coming
   Em
So you better run
 
G
