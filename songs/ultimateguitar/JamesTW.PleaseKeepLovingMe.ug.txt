[Intro]
 
F F F Fsus4/E Dm F/Bb
 
[Verse 1]
F     F/E         F/D
I know I have my moments
F      F/E                    F/D
And at times I'm hard to be around
F             C/E    F/D
I get impatient when you're getting dressed
        Dm/Bb            C                    F
It's just I thought the first one looked the best
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
               Bb
You're beautiful
                C/E
More than I deserve
             Bb
So listen close
                               C/E
To these one, two, three, four words
 
 
[Chorus]
  F        Csus4   Dm
So please keep loving me
           F       Csus4  Dm
Because our hearts speak fluently
            Bb            C
Wherever I go, whatever I do
           Dm
The map on my heart leads to you
       Bb          C        F
So baby, please keep loving me
        F                 Fsus4/E  Dm  F/Bb
Loving me, loving me, yeah
 
 
[Verse 2]
F    F/E         F/D
Your lips are my smile
F            F/E           F/D
Or like, bees 'round a honeycomb
F            C/E    F/D
You see through my heart's misty window
Dm/Bb            C                    F
And out of all the fingerprints, only yours will show
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
              Bb
You're beautiful
                  C/E
Before the make-up's on
                     Bb
And out of all the girls
                C/E
You're the one I want
 
 
[Chorus]
  F        Csus4      Dm
So please keep loving me
           F       Csus4  Dm
Because our hearts speak fluently
            Bb            C
Wherever I go, whatever I do
           Dm
The map on my heart leads to you
       Bb          C        F
So baby, please keep loving me
        F                 Fsus4/E  Dm Bb Gm
Loving me, loving me, yeah
 
 
[Bridge]
Gm             Am
For all the mistakes
                    Bb
I'm making, I don't mean
F/C                                   Gm
(I don't mean them, I don't mean them)
Gm                       Am
For all the little things
               Bb
That I fail to see
   C
My heart is on my sleeve
 
 
[Chorus]
F       C   Dm
Please keep loving me
           F       C       Dm
Because our hearts speak fluently
           Bb             C
Wherever I go, whatever I do
           Dm
The map on my heart leads to you
       Bb          C        F
So baby, please keep loving me
        F                 Fsus4/E
Loving me, loving me, yeah
 
 
[Outro]
Dm F/Bb
Oh, ooh
Bb        C        F
Please keep loving me
