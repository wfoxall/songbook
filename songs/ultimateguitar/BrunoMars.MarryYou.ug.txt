[Chorus]
       D
It’s a beautiful night,
                            Em
We’re looking for something dumb to do.
     G                              D
Hey baby, I think I want to marry you.
           D
Is it that look in your eyes,
              Em
Or is it this dancing juice?
     G                                  D
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you.
 
[Verse 1]
        D                                               Em
Well, I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go - oh-oh,
            G
No one will know - oh-oh,
         D
Oh, come on, girl.
    D                                                        Em
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow - oh-oh,
           G              D
Shots of Patron, and it's on girl.
 
[Pre-chorus]
          D
Don't say no, no, no, no-no;
         Em
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah;
          G
And we'll go, go, go-go, go.
          D
If you're ready, like I'm ready.
 
[Chorus]
             D
Cause it's a beautiful night,
                            Em
We're looking for something dumb to do.

Or is it this dancing juice?

Let's just run, girl.
D                                           Em
If we wake up and you wanna break up that's coo-oo-ool.
                  G                    D
No, I won't blame you -ooh-ooh; it was fun, girl.
