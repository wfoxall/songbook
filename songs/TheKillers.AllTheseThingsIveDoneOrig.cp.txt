[E]When there's nowhere else to ru[E7]n
Is there room for one more [A]son?
One more [E]son?
If you [C#m]can hold on,
If you [A]can hold on, hold[E]on.

{start_of_verse}
[E]I want to stand up, I want to let go
You know you know - no, you don't, you d[A]on't.
I want to shine on in the hearts of [E]men.
{end_of_verse}

I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand.

[E]Another head aches, another heart breaks.
I'm so much older than I can t[A]ake.
And my affection, well it comes and g[E]oes.

I need direction to perfection, no no no no

You know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the [A]back burner,
You know you gotta help me [E]out, yeah.

{start_of_verse}
[E]And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son[A]?
{end_of_verse}

These changes ain't changing me,
The c[E]old-hearted boy I used to be.

{start_of_chorus}
[E]Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the [A]back burner
You know you gotta help me o[E]ut, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself [C#m]down, yeah
{end_of_chorus}

[A]I got soul, but I'm not a soldie[E]r

{start_of_chorus}

You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the [A]back burner,
You're gonna bring yourself [E]down

{comment: Outro}
[C#m]Over and [F#m]in, last call for [A]sin.
While everyone's lost, the battle is [B]won
With all these things that I've [E]done.
With all these things that I've [C#m]done.
If you [A]can hold on, if you [B]can hold on.[E]..
