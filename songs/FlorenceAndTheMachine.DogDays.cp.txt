[G]  Happiness hit her like a train on a tr[Am]ack[Em]...
[G]  Coming towards her, stuck still no turning b[Am]ack[Em]...
[G]She hid around corners and she hid under beds
[G]  She killed it with kis[Am]ses and f[Em]rom it she fled
With [G]every bubble she sank with her drink
And wa[G]shed it aw[Am]ay down the [Em]kitchen sink

The [G]dog days are over
The [G]dog days are done
The [G]horses are [Am]coming
So [Em]you better run


{start_of_verse}
{end_of_verse}

Run [G]fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[G]Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[G]Leave all your loving, your lo[Am]ving behind
You can't [Em]carry it with you if you want to survive


{start_of_chorus}
{end_of_chorus}

The [G]dog days are over
The [G]dog days are done
[G]Can you hear the hor[Am]ses?
'Cause [Em]here they come[G]

(silence)

(quiet)

And [G]I [G]never wanted [G]anything [Am]from you[Em]
Except [G]for every[G]thing you had and [G]what was left [Am]after that [Em]too, oh

(loud again)

[G]Happiness hit her[G] like a bullet in the [G]hea[Am]d..[Em]...
[G] Struck from a great height[G] by someone who [G]should know bet[Am]ter than t[Em]hat

The [G]dog days are over
The [G]dog days are done
[G]Can you hear the hor[Am]ses?
'Cause [Em]here they come[G]
