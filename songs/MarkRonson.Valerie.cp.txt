All right, it's rolling
I'm sorry, Charlie Murphy, I was having too much fun

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?

Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Did you have to go to jail?

Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?

Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you found the right man who fixed it for you
Are you shopping anywhere?

Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?

And did you have to pay that fine
That you was dodging all the time
Are you still busy?

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?

Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?

Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
