{start_of_verse}
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
'Cause [F]since I've come on home. Well, my [Em]body's been a mess
And I've [F]missed your ginger hair. And the [Em]way you like to dress
[F]Won't you come on over? [C]Stop making a fool out of [G]me.

[G]Why don't you come on over,

[Cmaj7]Valerie? [Dmaj7]Valerie. [Cmaj7]Valerie. [Dmaj7]Valerie.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you found the right man who fixed it for you

Are you shopping anywhere?
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you was dodging all the time
Are you still busy?

'Cause [F]since I've come on home. Well, my [Em]body's been a mess
And I've [F]missed your ginger hair. And the [Em]way you like to dress
[F]Won't you come on over? [C]Stop making a fool out of [G]me.

[G]Why don't you come on over,

[Cmaj7]Valerie? [Dmaj7]Valerie. [Cmaj7]Valerie. [Dmaj7]Valerie.
