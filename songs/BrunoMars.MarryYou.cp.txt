It’s a [F]beautiful night,
We’re looking for something [Gm]dumb to do.
Hey b[A#]aby, I think I want to marry yo[F]u.
Is it that [F]look in your eyes,
Or is it this [Gm]dancing juice?
Who c[A#]ares baby, I think I wanna marry yo[F]u.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Well, I [F]know this little chapel on the boulevard we can [Gm]go - oh-oh,
No one will [A#]know - oh-oh,
Oh, come [F]on, girl.
Who [F]cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can [Gm]blow - oh-oh,
Shots of Pa[A#]tron, and it's [F]on girl.
{end_of_verse}

{comment: Pre-chorus}
Don't say [F]no, no, no, no-no;
Just say [Gm]yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah;
And we'll [A#]go, go, go-go, go.
If you're [F]ready, like I'm ready.

{start_of_chorus}
Cause it's a [F]beautiful night,
We're looking for something [Gm]dumb to do.
Hey b[A#]aby, I think I wanna marry yo[F]u.

Or is it this [Gm]dancing juice?

[F]I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing, like [Gm]oooh-ooh-ooh,
So whatcha wanna [A#]do-ooh-ooh?
Let's just [F]run, girl.
[F]If we wake up and you wanna break up that's [Gm]coo-oo-ool.
No, I won't blame [A#]you -ooh-ooh; it was [F]fun, girl.
