[G]

{start_of_verse}
I stay out too [Am]late
Got nothing in my [C]brain
That's what people [G]say, mmm
{end_of_verse}

That's what people say, mmm
I go on too many [Am]dates
But I can't make 'em [C]stay
At least that's what people [G]say, mmm

That's what people say, mmm

{comment: Pre-Chorus 1}
But I keep [Am]cruisin'
Can't stop won't stop [C]moving
It's like I got this [G]music in my mind
Saying [G]it's gonna be alright

{start_of_chorus}
Cause the [Am]players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [C]haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
[G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heart [Am]breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [C]fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
[G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
{end_of_chorus}

Shake it off, I shake it off

{start_of_verse}
I never miss a [Am*]beat
I'm lightening on my [C*]feet
And that's what they dont' [G]see, mmm
That's what they dont' see, mmm
I'm dancing on my [Am]own (dancing on my own)
I'll make the moves up as I [C]go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't [G]know, mmm
{end_of_verse}

That's what they don't know, mmm

{comment: Pre-Chorus 2}
But I keep [Am]cruisin'
Can't stop won't stop [C]groovin'
It's like I got this [G]music in my mind
       G*/mute
Saying it's gonna be alright

{start_of_chorus}
Cause the [Am]players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [C]haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
[G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heart [Am]breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [C]fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
[G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off (oooh oooh oooh oooh)
{end_of_chorus}

*tap guitar to the beat*
N.C.
Hey, hey, hey, just think

While you've been gettin' down and out

About the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world

You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat
