{start_of_verse}
[Cm]There's a fire [Gm]starting in my heart,
[Bb]Reaching a fever pitch, and it's b[Gm]ringing me out the dark[Bb]
[Cm]Finally, I can [Gm]see you crystal clear
[Bb]Go ahead and sell me out, and I'[Gm]ll lay your shit bare[Bb]

{start_of_verse}
[Cm]See how I'll leave with [Gm]every piece of you
[Bb]Don't underestimate the t[Gm]hings that I will do[Bb]
[Cm]There's a fire [Gm]starting in my heart
[Bb]Reaching a fever pitch, and it's b[Gm]ringing me out the dark[Bb]

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[Ab]   The scars of y[Bb]our love, remind me of[Gm] us
They keep me [Ab]thinking that we almost had i[Bb]t al[Ab]l
The scars of [Bb]your love, they leave me b[Gm]reathless
I can't help [G7#5]feeling...


{start_of_chorus}
We could have had it [Cm]all... (You're gonna wish you, [Bb]never had met me)...
Rolling in the [Ab]deep (Tears are gonna fall, r[Ab]olling in the de[Bb]ep)
You [(Bb)]had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... In[Cm]side of your ha[Bb]nd (Never had met me)
And you pla[Ab]yed it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the be[Ab]at (Rolling in the de[Bb]ep)
{end_of_chorus}


{start_of_verse}
[Cm]Baby, I have no [Gm]story to be told,
But [Bb]I've heard one on you. Now I'm g[Gm]onna make your head burn[Bb]
[Cm]Think of me in the [Gm]depths of your despair
[Bb]Make a home down there, as m[Gm]ine sure won't be shared[Bb]

[(Bb)]Could have had it [Ab]all     [Bb]
Rolling in the [Cm]deep[Bb]
You had my heart in[Ab]side of your ha[Ab]nd
But you pla[Bb]yed it    with a bea[Bb]ting

{comment: N.C.}
Throw yourself through every open door (Whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Whoa-uh)
[Cm]Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.
