[F#]When there's nowhere else to ru[F#7]n
Is there room for one more [B]son?
One more [F#]son?
If you [D#m]can hold on,
If you [B]can hold on, hold[F#]on.

{start_of_verse}
[F#]I want to stand up, I want to let go
You know you know - no, you don't, you d[B]on't.
I want to shine on in the hearts of [F#]men.
{end_of_verse}

I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand.

[F#]Another head aches, another heart breaks.
I'm so much older than I can t[B]ake.
And my affection, well it comes and g[F#]oes.

I need direction to perfection, no no no no

[F#]Help me out, yeah

You know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the [B]back burner,
You know you gotta help me [F#]out, yeah.

{start_of_verse}
[F#]And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son[B]?
{end_of_verse}

These changes ain't changing me,
The c[F#]old-hearted boy I used to be.

{start_of_chorus}
[F#]Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh don't you put me on the [B]back burner
You know you gotta help me o[F#]ut, yeah

{comment: Outro}
[D#m]Over and [G#m]in, last call for [B]sin.
While everyone's lost, the battle is [C#]won
With all these things that I've [F#]done.
With all these things that I've [D#m]done.
If you [B]can hold on, if you [C#]can hold on.[F#]..
