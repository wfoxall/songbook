[Cmaj7]       [Dm7/Bb]  (Yo', m[Cmaj7]an) Yo'[Bbmaj7]
(Open up, man[Cmaj7]) What do you want, man?[Dm7/Bb]
(My girl just [Cmaj7]caught me) [Bbmaj7]You let her catch you?
[Cmaj7](I don't know how I let this [Dm7/Bb]happen) With [Cmaj7]who?
(The girl next [Bbmaj7]door, you know[Cmaj7]) Man
[Dm7/Bb](I don't know what to do)[Cmaj7] Say it wasn't you [Bbmaj7](Alright)

{start_of_verse}
[Cmaj7]Honey came in and she [Dm7/Bb]caught me red-handed
[Cmaj7]Creeping with the girl next [Bbmaj7]door
[Cmaj7]Picture this, we were [Dm7/Bb]both butt-naked
[Cmaj7]Banging on the bathroom [Bbmaj7]floor
How could [Cmaj7]I for--[Dm7/Bb]get that I had
[Cmaj7]Given her an extra [Bbmaj7]key
All this [Cmaj7]time she was [Dm7/Bb]standing there
She [Cmaj7]never took her eyes off [Bbmaj7]me

How you [Cmaj7]can grant the woman access to your [Dm7/Bb]villa
Trespasser and a [Cmaj7]witness while you cling to your [Bbmaj7]pillow
You better watch your [Cmaj7]back before she turn into a [Dm7/Bb]killer
Best for you and the [Cmaj7]situation not to call the [Bbmaj7]beaner
To be a true [Cmaj7]player you have to know how to [Dm7/Bb]play
If she say a [Cmaj7]night, convince her say a [Bbmaj7]day
Never ad[Cmaj7]mit to a word when she [Dm7/Bb]say
And if she claims and [Cmaj7]you tell her baby no [Bbmaj7]way

{start_of_chorus}
[Cmaj7]But she caught me on the [Dm7/Bb]counter (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]Saw me bangin' on the [Bbmaj7]sofa (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]I even had her in the [Dm7/Bb]shower (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]She even caught me on [Bbmaj7]camera (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]She saw the marks on my [Dm7/Bb]shoulder (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]Heard the words that I [Bbmaj7]told her (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]Heard the scream get [Dm7/Bb]louder (It wasn't me)
[Cmaj7]She stayed until it was [Bbmaj7]over

[Cmaj7]Creeping with the girl next [Bbmaj7]door
[Cmaj7]Picture this, we were [Dm7/Bb]both butt-naked
[Cmaj7]Banging on the bathroom [Bbmaj7]floor
I had [Cmaj7]tried to [Dm7/Bb]keep her
From what [Cmaj7]she was about to [Bbmaj7]see
Why should [Cmaj7]she be[Dm7/Bb]lieve me
When I [Cmaj7]told her it wasn't [Bbmaj7]me

Make sure she knows it's [Cmaj7]not you and lead her on the right [Dm7/Bb]prefix
Whenever you should [Cmaj7]see her make the giggolo [Bbmaj7]flex
As funny as it [Cmaj7]be by you, it not that com[Dm7/Bb]plex
Seeing is be[Cmaj7]lieving so you better change your [Bbmaj7]specs
You know she not gonna [Cmaj7]be worrying 'bout things from the [Dm7/Bb]past
Hardly recol[Cmaj7]lecting and then she'll go to noontime [Bbmaj7]mass
Wait for your [Cmaj7]answer: go over [Dm7/Bb]there
But if she pack a [Cmaj7]gun you know you better run [Bbmaj7]fast

Gonna [Cmaj7]tell her that I'm [Dm7/Bb]sorry
For the [Cmaj7]pain that I've [Bbmaj7]caused
I've been [Cmaj7]listening to your [Dm7/Bb]reason
It makes [Cmaj7]no sense at all[Bbmaj7]
We should [Cmaj7]tell her that I'm [Dm7/Bb]sorry
For the [Cmaj7]pain that I've [Bbmaj7]caused
You may [Cmaj7]think that you're a [Dm7/Bb]player
But you're [Cmaj7]completely [Bbmaj7]lost. That's why I sing
