[Ab]Uh Huh, Yea Okay,
[Fm]could it be that you,
are at the[Fm7/Bb] crib with anotha [Bdim7]lady?
[Cm]If you took it there,

to sit [Fm7/Bb]around and be p[Bdim7]layed

[Cm]I know you say that I am assuming things
[Ab]Something's going down thats the way it seems
[Fm]Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
[Fm7/Bb]If nobody's holding you [Bdim7]back from me
Cause I kn[Cm]ow how you usually do
When you say ev[Ab]erything to me times two
[Fm]Why can't you just tell the truth?
If [Fm7/Bb]somebody's there then [Bdim7]tell me who

[Cm]What is up with this?
Tell the tr[Ab]uth, who you with?
How w[Fm]ould you like it if
[Fm7/Bb]I came over with my c[Bdim7]lique
[Cm]Don't try to change it now
Sayin’ y[Ab]ou gotta bounce
When t[Fm]wo seconds ago
you said you[Fm7/Bb] just got in the h[Bdim7]ouse.
It's h[Cm]ard to believe that you,
are at h[Ab]ome, by yourself
when I j[Fm]ust heard the voice
heard the[Fm7/Bb] voice of someon[Bdim7]e else.
[Cm]Just this question
Why do you fe[Ab]el you gotta lie?
Gettin ca[Fm]ught up in your game
when y[Fm7/Bb]ou can not say my [Bdim7]name
