One, two, three, four


Well, she was [E]just seventeen
You [A]know what I [E]mean
And the [(E)]way she looked
Was [(E)]way beyond com[B]pare
So [E]how could I [E/Ab]dance with a[A]nother [C]
Ooh, when I [E]saw her [B]standing [E]there?



Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there


Well, my [A]heart went, "Boom"

When I [(A)]crossed that room
And I [(A)]held her hand in [B]mine....[A]


Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there


Well, my heart went, "Boom"

When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine


Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
