[Am]Weep for yourself, my man
you'll never be what is in your[C]heart
[Am]Weep little lion man
you're not as brave as you were at the[C]start

[F]problems that you [Fmaj7]made in your own[C]head

But it was [Am]not your [F]fault but m[C]ine
and it was [Am]your heart [F]on the l[C]ine

didn't I, my[G]dear?
Didn't I, my[Am][C][Am][C]

[Am]Tremble for yourself, my man
you know that you have seen this all b[C]efore
[Am]Tremble little lion man
you'll never settle any of your[C]scores
Your [G]grace is wasted in your face
your [F]boldness stands a[Fmaj7]lone among the [C]wreck
Now [G]learn from your mother or else
[F]spend your days [Fmaj7]biting your [C]own neck
